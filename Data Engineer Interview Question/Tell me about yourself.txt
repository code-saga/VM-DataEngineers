Hi, good morning / good afternoon.

I’m Sagar Lagare. I have five years of experience as a Data Engineer.

I completed my Engineering degree in 2020 from JSS Science and Technology University, Mysore,

My professional career began at Accenture, where I worked as Software Engineer.
During this time, I gained strong experience in technologies like Xquery, Javascript ,SQL ,Marklogic NoSql db 
and worked on Agile methodology.

Currently, I am working at ValueMomentum, a company focused on the P&C insurance domain.
Here, I have contributed to several important projects, including 
ERIE Auto Program covering both personal and commercial lines, ESH (Erie Secure Homes), and WC (Workers’ Compensation).

In terms of technology, I specialize in building and maintaining data pipelines using
PySpark, SQL, Azure and Databricks. Within Databricks, 
I have strong hands-on experience with Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, and Delta Live Tables (DLT).
Ensuring data quality, security, and performance across the platform.
