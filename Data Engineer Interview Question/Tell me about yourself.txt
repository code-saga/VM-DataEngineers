Hi, good morning / good afternoon.

I’m Sagar Lagare. I have five years of experience as a Data Engineer.

I graduated in August 2020 with an engineering degree from JSS Science and Technology University, Mysore,
where I studied from 2016 to 2020.

My professional career began at Accenture, where I worked from February 2021 to July 2023.
During this time, I gained strong experience in technologies like Xquery, Javascript and Marklogic NoSql db , SQL
and worked on Agile methodology.

Currently, I am working at ValueMomentum, a company focused on the P&C insurance domain.
Here, I have contributed to multiple projects, including 
ERIE Auto Program covering both personal and commercial lines, ESH (Erie Secure Homes), and WC (Workers’ Compensation).

In terms of technology, I specialize in building and maintaining data pipelines using
Python, SQL, Azure, and Databricks. Within Databricks, 
I have hands-on experience with Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, and Delta Live Tables (DLT) 
to ensure scalable, secure, and reliable data processing.

Would you like me to explain the projects I have worked on in more detail?
